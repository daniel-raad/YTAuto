Youtube automation - creating compilation videos 


Steps: 
1) A script to download files with a certain tag from TikTok 
2) A script to merge the videos together 
3) A script to generate a good name for the youtube video based on the tags 
4) A script to post the video to Youtube 


This will be a fully automated journey - perhaps even creating logos from automation / generative art
